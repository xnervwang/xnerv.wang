== Installation ==

1. Upload `ajax-search-lite` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place the shortcode from the settings into your template or post-page

== Frequently asked questions ==

= After an update, the plugin stopped working, why? =

It's most likely a cache related issue. Make sure to clear all website cache, including page, minify, browser and CDN as well.

= The images are not showing, what is wrong? =

The search parses the first image from the post/page content. Most likely there 
is no image in post.

= When I type in something, the search wheel is spinning, but nothing happens =

It is most likely, that another plugin or the template is throwing errors while the
ajax request is generated. Disabling all the plugins one by one can help you rule out which plugin
is creating the issue.

= I disabled all the plugins but the search wheel is still spinning to infinity, nothing happens =

You should contact me on the support forum with your website url. I will check your website
and will let you know what to do.
